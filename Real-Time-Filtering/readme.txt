Introduction:
This project is designed to perform real-time filtering on images using OpenCV and C++. The program is developed in Visual Studio on Windows operating system. The project includes options for filtering images based on different techniques and user-defined parameters. The user can also write the filtered image to a local directory and read images from the same directory.

The user can select the desired option and enter the necessary parameters. For captioning, the user will be prompted to enter a string.

Requirements:

Visual Studio on Windows operating system
OpenCV library
C++ programming language
Notes:

The program uses default parameters for levels and magThreshold, which can be changed as per requirement for optimal results.
