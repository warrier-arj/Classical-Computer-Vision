Content-Based Image Retrieval Project by Arjun Rajeev Warrier

Introduction:
This project focuses on image retrieval using histograms and channel values. The program was developed in C++ using OpenCV library. The project includes options for baseline matching, histogram matching, multi-histogram matching, texture and color-based feature vectors, and a custom design. The program displays the top three matches for the target image based on the selected method.

Usage:
To run the program, load the images into the same folder as the executable. The program will display the top three matches for the target image based on the selected method. The user can modify the weights assigned to different distance metrics in the custom design.

Requirements:

C++ programming language
OpenCV library
Notes:

The project covers basic usage of OpenCV functions for image access and modification in C++.
The project explores different methods of comparing and finding relationships between images using pixel values and edge filters.
The project uses vectors for feature storage and provides an idea of how image retrieval can be used with machine learning.
